function [all_memb, filtmat] = rmt_community_louvain(X, varargin)
% This function returns a hierarchical decomposition of the timeseries
% contained in the multidimensional matrix X. The matrix has three indices
% in the form [NSubjects, NSamples, NRegions]. If your matrix has a
% different shape, you need to rearrange the dimensions the indices using
% the function "permute" in Matlab.
%
% This anonymous function is a wrapper for the network generator process
% that just starts from the time series and the selected ROIs
% This "generator" function helps to compute the average on the prefiltered subjects
% as follows:
% 1. Filter each subject with the included RMTFilter function
% 2. Convert the cells back to an array and Fisher transform it, by taking
% the atanh.
% 3. Compute the averages on the Fisher transformed matrix
% 4. Convert it back with inverse Fisher transformation to be it a proper
% correlation matrix.
% The inputs to the generator anonymouse function must be the TimeSeries
% and the ROIs one is interested to look. At the first run, all ROIs are
% analyzed. Subject level filtering
generator_pre_filt = @(TS,ROIs)tanh(mean(atanh(reshape(cell2mat(arrayfun(@(subj)RMTFilter(squeeze(TS(subj,:,ROIs))), 1:size(TS,1),'UniformOutput',false)), [length(ROIs),length(ROIs),size(TS,1)])),3));

% another possibility is to filter the inverse Fisher transformed of the average of the Fisher transformed
% correlation matrices of the subjects. Group level filtering
generator_post_filt = @(TS,ROIs)RMTFilter(tanh(mean(atanh(reshape(cell2mat(arrayfun(@(subj)corrcoef(squeeze(TS(subj,:,ROIs))),1:size(TS,1),'UniformOutput',false)),[length(ROIs),length(ROIs),size(TS,1)])),3)),length(ROIs),size(TS,2));

%% another possibility is to concatenate all the time series
generator_concatenate = @(TS,ROIs)RMTFilter(catalongfirstdim(squeeze(TS(:,:,ROIs))));

function all_levels_memb = hierarchical_timeseries_community_detection(TS,method,nodes)
% HIERARCHICAL_TIMESERIES_COMMUNITY_DETECTION
% Apply recursively the community detection method "cd_alg" which takes as
% input an adjacency matrix. This function has a slight variation with
% respect to its parent, because in this variation we need to reconstruct
% an input matrix not by just slicing the adjacency matrix with indices of
% the nodes in the community, but by explicitly recomputing the correlation
% matrix from the timeseries itself.
%
%% Syntax
%
% Inputs:
% TS are the [NSubj x NSamples x NROIs] timeseries to analyze
% method : an anonymous function taking as input the timeseries, an
% anonymouse generator function and the subset of nodes.
% nodes: the subsect of nodes to analyze
%
% Outputs:
% Returns an NNodes x NLevels array with the memberships of each node.
% The nodal memberships are indexed in a way such that is possible to
% reconstruct from which community at level l-1 the node i was at the level
% l.
% Each column has membership values that are strictly larger than the
% previous level, so to get the nodes at level 2 that where in the
% community 3 at level 1, you can do:
% N(N(:,1)==3,2)
%
all_levels_memb = method(TS,nodes);

% Hierarchically go into each community, by refiltering the timeseries
% belonging to that community and reapplying the community detection method

function M = RMTFilter(X,varargin)
%% RMTFilter
% RMTFilter uses Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to create a filtered correlation
% matrix from a set of time series data.
%% Syntax
% M=RMTFilter(X)
%
%% Description
% This function eigendecomposes a correlation matrix of time series
% and splits it into three components, Crandom, Cgroup and Cmarket,
% according to techniques from literature (See, "Systematic Identification
% of Group Identification in Stock Markets, Kim & Jeong, (2008).") and
% returns a filtered correlation matrix containging only the Cgroup
% components.
% The function is intended to be used in conjunction with a community
% detection algorithm (such as the Louvain method) to allow for community
% detecion on time series based networks.
%
%
%% Inputs arguments:
% X : an mxn matrix containing timeseries' of stock prices. Each column
% should be a time series for one financial instrument and each row should
% correspond to the value of each instrument at a point in time. For example
% 32.00   9.43   127.25   ...
% 32.07   9.48   126.98   ...
%
%% Outputs:
% M : The filtered correlation matrix. This matrix can be passed directly to
% a community detection algorithm in place of the modularity matrix
%
%% Example:
% ModularityMatrix = RMTFilter(myPriceData)
% Communities = myCommunityDectionAlg(ModularityMatrix)
%
%% Issues & Comments
% Note that the output of this function can serve as the Modularity
% Matrix (Not the Adjacency matrix) for a generalized Community Detection
% Algorithm.
