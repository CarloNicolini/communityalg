# Datasets
This repository contains the 638 areas template used by Crossley (2013). It consists of two files:

1. `template.nii` is the NIFTI file describing the template, MNI space
2. `template_638.txt` is the description of anatomical a


Additionally the file `template_638_coords_abbr.txt`  is organized as follows

| Node |  X | Y | Z | Label | Abbr|
|------|----|---|---|-------|-----|


and differently from `template_638.txt` the NodeID starts from 0 to 637 (for indexing with Python).
